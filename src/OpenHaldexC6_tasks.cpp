// ---- Long Learn ------------------------------------------------------------
// Finds which STATIC frame blocks the Haldex actually needs. The lock-driven
// blocks (frameEditLockDriven - the ones we edit to have control) are always
// sent; everything else is a candidate:
//   1. Reference: every block on - as standalone sends the bus - one full
//      0-100 sweep on the unit's own settings.
//   2. BPK Adjust (Gen5 only, only when that sweep hunts - not smooth - or is
//      short of LL_BPK_ACCEPT): switch Motor_11 to BPK packing ("Fix
//      Hunting") and keep it only if a real sweep is better; if still short
//      on level, walk the torque ceiling up to the lowest value that reaches
//      100%. Whatever wins is KEPT when the run completes.
//   3. Prove it: the all-on sweep on the settled settings must be smooth (re-
//      swept if BPK moved the ceiling). Then two quick reads at each
//      LL_POINT_CF (20/40/70/100) with everything on; their spread is the
//      noise floor blocks are judged against. Not smooth, or spread >
//      LL_NOISE_MAX, stops the run - no trustworthy reference to compare with.
//   4. Testing Blocks: each candidate is turned off ON ITS OWN (everything else
//      on), read at the same points (release-to-0 before each), then turned
//      back on. A change beyond the noise floor at any point means the block
//      matters; otherwise "no effect". Points can't see a step between them -
//      that is left to the full confirmation sweep.
//   5. Confirmation: every "no effect" block off together, full sweep compared
//      CF-by-CF with the step-3 curve. If it still matches it becomes the
//      final set and stored table; if not (a step between the test points, or
//      blocks covering for each other) every block is left on, the reference
//      table is stored and the run is flagged as an interaction.
// In standalone "off" means the frame is not sent at all; in normal mode it
// means the car's own frame passes through untouched. Cancel / failure
// restores the mask, floor, torque ceiling, Fix Hunting and learn table.
