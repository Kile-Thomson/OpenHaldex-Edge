</p>

OpenHaldex is an **open-source Haldex AWD controller** for Volkswagen and Audi Group vehicles using Haldex Generation 1, 2, 4 (PQ Chassis) and 5 (MQB) differentials. The full source and hardware files are published under the permissive **MIT License**, so anyone is free to use, modify, and redistribute them, and it incorporates MIT‑licensed upstream work — see [Licensing](#licensing).

Install is easy with the new harnesses for later PQ & MQB chassis:

**Lift seat -> Plug in -> Drive it**

**Performance doesn't need to be expensive or complicated!**

Starting from the codebase from A-Banging-Donk for Generation 1 differentials; OpenHaldexC6 has grown to adapt Generation 2, 4 and 5.  

The firmware runs on an **ESP32‑C6** and reads CAN bus messages from the vehicle, allowing the controller to modify or generate commands so the Haldex differential behaves exactly as you've configured.  

It can operate using OEM CAN signals or it is able to run in Standalone mode - which makes it perfect for conversions!

## Purchase

Assembled modules are available from Forbes Automotive if you do not wish to build one yourself:

➡ **[OpenHaldex C6 Controller – Forbes Automotive](https://forbes-automotive.com/products/openhaldex-controller?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=openhaldex)**

---

## Overview

OpenHaldex-C6 sits between your vehicle and the OEM Haldex controller. It can operate as a passthrough (OEM behaviour), and modify messages to request different amounts of differential lock.  

This is the original source of Generation 2, 4 (including GM) and 5 logic - any forks or code copied from this project is NOT the work of Forbes Automotive and therefore we cannot support other work unless it is remains part of this project.

**Supported generations:** Gen1, Gen2, Gen4 and Gen5

> Gen3 is currently unsupported.

---

## Hardware

The PCB is based around an **ESP32‑C6 Mini** (with Wi‑Fi) and has superior protection against ESD and transient voltages.  It has a built-in fuse and uses quality automotive based components for a reliable system.

Two TWAI/CAN controllers are built into the PCB along with external IO control:

- External mode button
- On‑board RGB LED
- Brake / handbrake management (for Generation 1 systems)
  *Note: some brake/handbrake outputs may require a 10k pulldown resistor on certain platforms(!)

These two high‑side drivers for brake/handbrake could be repurposed for other functions like oil coolers!

> This platform replaces the earlier Teensy (OpenHaldex T4) design to provide wireless support and on‑device configuration.

## Supported Platforms

- Generation 1 - PQ 
- Generation 2 - PQ
- Generation 4 - PQ
- Generation 4 - GM
- Generation 4 - Ford (ongoing)
- Generation 5 - MQB (0CQ)
- Generation 5 - PQ (0AY)
- Generation 5 - MQB (VAQ)

---

## Modes

The controller provides several preset modes along with a fully customisable 'Expert' mode':

| Mode | Behaviour | LED Colour |
|-----|-----------|-----------|
| Stock | OEM behaviour | Red |
| FWD | Zero lock | Green | 
| 7525 | 25% lock | Cyan |
| 6040 | 40% lock | Magenta |
| 5050 | 100% lock | Blue |
| Expert | User‑defined lock | White |

  &nbsp;&nbsp;
  <img src="/Images/ui-live-data.png" alt="Dashboard — live speed, throttle, RPM, boost and per-wheel slip" width="300">
</p>

*Dashboard: pick a mode, watch the engagement gauge follow the request (with the last 15 s of actual vs target underneath), and keep an eye on the live data and wheel slip further down the page.*

The **Basic** tab holds the simple guards that apply to every mode — disengage below or above a speed, a minimum throttle before any lock is applied, and how quickly lock is released:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/Images/ui-basic.png" alt="Basic tab — disengage speeds, minimum throttle and lock release rate" width="300">
</p>

---

## Expert Mode

Expert mode allows lock targets to be configured based on **speed and throttle setpoints** using a table inside the Web UI. This is true **full control** over your Haldex system. No guesswork. You tune it and it'll do exactly what you want it to do, every time.  It requires OEM CAN messages to be present for throttle/speed inputs.

![ExpertMode](/Images/expertmode.png)

*Expert mode grid configuration interface within the OpenHaldex-C6 UI.*

The rest of the **Expert** tab draws the same table as a lock-map surface, and adds an optional **Steering-Angle Lock Scale** — a five-point curve that trims the commanded lock as steering-wheel angle increases (full lock straight ahead, FWD bias in tight turns). It applies to Gen2, Gen4 and Gen5 (0CQ/VAQ) and to every mode, not just Expert:

</p>

---

## Haldex Learning

Allow the controller to learn *your* Haldex by replacing the original methodology of approximating a lock percentage by cycling through all of the available lock percentages.  

Use the 'Learn Haldex' in the Settings page and within one minute the controller will learn how to get EXACTLY the lock percentage you request.  No more approximations, just exact values.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/Images/ui-settings.png" alt="Settings — Haldex generation and the Learn Haldex card with Fix Hunting" width="300">
</p>

*Settings: pick the Haldex generation, then run **Learn Haldex**. The card reports whether a learned table is active and carries the Gen5 **Fix Hunting** toggle described below.*

### Long Learn (automated block bisection)

If a normal learn isn't clean (jumps, plateaus, never reaches 100%), **Long Learn** on the Settings page automates the manual "add/remove a frame, learn again" loop, in four phases:

1. **Initial Sweep** — every editable frame block for the selected generation is switched **on** and one learn is run at the **Launch PWM Floor** currently configured. The floor governs the *ramp* (how fast the clutch takes up and releases lock), not how far it can ultimately go, so it isn't hunted through candidate values here — this step just establishes the baseline shape and whether 100% is already reachable as configured.
2. **BPK Adjust** *(Gen5 only, only runs if step 1 didn't reach 100%)* — if the floor alone can't get to 100%, the torque ceiling itself (**Lock Calibration**, `bpkCeilingNm`) is what's capping it. This step forces **Fix Hunting** on for the rest of the run (the default packing has no ceiling concept at all and would otherwise let the sweep silently ignore whatever ceiling is set) and walks the ceiling up in fixed steps, using quick single-point checks at full lock rather than a full sweep, until 100% is reached or the ceiling hits its safe maximum. Fix Hunting itself is **always reverted** to whatever it was before at the end of the run, win or lose — only the calibrated ceiling *value* is kept, so it needs turning on by hand afterward to actually take effect.
3. **Sweeping Blocks** — with the calibrated floor/ceiling locked in, each *additional* block (anything outside the generation's default set) is removed one at a time and checked with a quick **release-to-0-then-back-to-100%** cycle (not a full 101-step re-sweep, but a real cycle rather than a frozen hold — holding steady at 100% and just flipping the mask bit turned out to be unreliable, since the controller doesn't cleanly re-evaluate a step change while already sitting at max). Any block whose removal *affects* the result goes back on — **needed** if it got worse (including feedback dropping to nothing — that's the strongest possible "needed" signal, not a failure), flagged **affects (better without)** if it improved; one that makes no difference is **not needed** and stays off. Tick *Also test the default (core) blocks* to bisect everything.
4. **Confirmation** — a full sweep is stored against the final block set (this is the one place a full 0–100% sweep still matters, since the stored table is used to interpolate every lock target, not just 100%).

Expect 10–20 minutes with the car running and Haldex CAN active. The tracker shows the current phase, sweep count, the block under test, the current floor and torque ceiling, the reference score and the live Sent/Returned bars. Cancelling (or losing Haldex data during the Initial Sweep or Confirmation phases) restores the blocks, floor, torque ceiling, Fix Hunting toggle and learn table that were in place before the run.

Below the tracker, a **Chassis / car notes** box (saved on the unit) and **Export report (.txt)** produce a plain-text record of the car, calibration values, the recommended block set (as a checklist plus the raw mask), the full sweep log and the stored learn table — handy for sharing a known-good layout for a given chassis.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/Images/ui-long-learn.png" alt="Settings — Long Learn card with notes and report export, and the Gen 5 Lock Calibration card" width="300">
</p>

*Settings: the Long Learn card (with the core-blocks option, notes and report export) and, beneath it, the **Gen 5 Lock Calibration** card — the torque ceiling (`Lock Calibration`) and `Launch PWM Floor` that Long Learn adjusts.*

### Gen5 'Fix Hunting'

Certain Generation 5 controllers — specifically those running the **554K** variant — use a different torque model to calculate the lock request. On these units, the standard learning process will not produce accurate results. Use the **Fix Hunt** option in the Settings page to ensure the correct torque model is used.

## Changing Modes

Modes can be changed using multiple interfaces:

**On‑board button**

Press the `Mode` button to cycle through modes.

**Wi‑Fi**

Use the Web UI at:

```
192.168.1.1 or openhaldex.local
```

**CAN**

See [CAN Broadcast / Change Mode](#can-broadcast--change-mode) for the required **Broadcast over CAN** setting, CAN IDs and mode byte.

**CAN — Force Mode (Hazards / TC Button)**

Two optional force mode triggers are available via. CAN signals already present on the bus:

- **Hazard lights** — activating the hazard switch will trigger a force mode command
- **TC button** — pressing the traction control button can also trigger force mode

Both are optional and can be enabled in the Settings page. They allow mode changes from OEM controls without any additional wiring.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/Images/ui-mode-options.png" alt="Settings — Mode Options (TC / hazard / external button force modes and their priority) and Output Options (brake and handbrake follow)" width="300">
</p>

*Settings → **Mode Options**: each force-mode trigger has its own target mode, the external button can either advance or hold-to-force, and a priority order settles what happens when several triggers are active at once. **Output Options** underneath sets whether the brake and handbrake outputs follow (or invert) the inputs.*

---

## CAN Broadcast / Change Mode

The same **Broadcast over CAN** setting enables both:

- External mode-change commands received by the controller on `0x6A0`
- OpenHaldex state broadcast from the controller on `0x6B0`

> [!NOTE]
> Enabling these features will broadcast NEW CAN IDs the system might already look for(!).  Caution should be exercised when using this feature(!). 

### Change Mode Request

**Broadcast over CAN must be enabled** in Settings, otherwise the controller will ignore the mode-change frame.

Send a standard 11-bit CAN frame to `0x6A0`. Put the required mode value in **Byte 0 / data[0]**. If sending an 8-byte frame, set unused bytes to `0x00`.

| CAN ID | Byte | Value | Mode |
|----|----|----|----|
| `0x6A0` | `0` / `data[0]` | `0x01` | Stock |
| `0x6A0` | `0` / `data[0]` | `0x02` | FWD |
| `0x6A0` | `0` / `data[0]` | `0x03` | 50:50 |
| `0x6A0` | `0` / `data[0]` | `0x04` | 60:40 |
| `0x6A0` | `0` / `data[0]` | `0x05` | 75:25 |
| `0x6A0` | `0` / `data[0]` | `0x06` | Expert |

### Broadcasted State

Default CAN ID:

```
0x6B0
```
The module broadcasts its current state on the CAN bus.  This can be used by aftermarket ECUs or FIS displays to show current status

```
data[0] = reserved 
data[1] = standalone flags (bitmask for Gen1/Gen2/Gen4/Gen5)
data[2] = processed haldex engagement (requested by firmware)
data[3] = lock target percent (actual lock, returned by differential)
data[4] = vehicle speed (kmh)
data[5] = mode_override_flag (legacy)
data[6] = current_mode_number (0...5)
data[7] = driver's pedal value (percentage: 0...100%)
```

---

## Wi‑Fi Setup

1. Connect to the access point **OpenHaldex‑C6** (open by default).
2. Open a browser and navigate to

```
192.168.1.1 or openhaldex.local
```

3. Access the Web UI

### Connecting from a phone

**Use your phone's Wi‑Fi settings — not its Personal Hotspot / hotspot feature.** The controller is the access point: it broadcasts its own Wi‑Fi network (**OpenHaldex‑C6** by default), the same way a home router does. Your phone just joins that network like any other:

1. Phone **Settings → Wi‑Fi** → select **OpenHaldex‑C6** and connect (open network by default, no password).
2. Browse to `192.168.1.1` or `openhaldex.local`.

Do **not** turn on your phone's own Hotspot/Personal Hotspot for this — that shares *your* phone's data with other devices, which is the opposite of what's needed here and won't let the phone reach the controller.

> [!NOTE]
> The controller has no internet access and doesn't need any. Your phone will show *"Wi‑Fi has no internet access"* while connected — that's expected; dismiss it. If the phone keeps dropping the network (some Android versions do this to a Wi‑Fi with no internet), tap the warning and choose **"Stay connected"**. 

If you get stuck mid-way (e.g. the phone auto‑connects to OpenHaldex‑C6 in the background and you didn't mean to), just forget the network or reconnect — the controller keeps running normally whether or not anything is connected to it.

From the **Diagnostics** page you can:

- **Change the WiFi Name (SSID)** — set any 1–32 character printable name (e.g. `MyHaldex`, `MK7-R`). The AP restarts immediately on save.
- **Set / change the WiFi Password** — WPA2, minimum 8 characters. Leave blank for an open network.

If you are locked out or forget your password, **long-pressing the `Mode` button** will clear the WiFi password and restore the open AP. The SSID is preserved (use **Reset to Default** in the UI if you want to revert the name to `OpenHaldex-C6`).

<p align="center">
  <img src="/Images/ui-wifi.png" alt="Diagnostics — WiFi Name (SSID) and WiFi Password cards" width="300">
</p>

*Diagnostics: rename the access point and set or clear its WPA2 password.*

<p align="center">
  <img src="/Images/UIDemo.png" alt="OpenHaldex C6 Web UI" width="900" style="max-width:100%;">
</p>

If the Wi‑Fi interface becomes unresponsive:

- Long‑press the `Mode` button to clear the WiFi password and restart the AP to an open state.

> The Web UI is built on Forbes Automotive's shared dark theme (the same look used across the Can2Cluster, SpeedPulser, SpeedPulserPro, can2rpm, MQB Steering Wheel Controller and AirLift Controller firmware), so the interface and status conventions stay consistent across the whole product line. Current firmware version: **9.00.0** (shown in the UI footer and at `/ota/info`).

---

## Low Power Mode

OpenHaldex C6 is designed to live on a **permanent +12 V** feed without flattening your battery. With Low Power Mode configured correctly the controller draws approximately:

| State | Current |
|---|---|
| Sleeping (car off, WiFi off, CAN quiet) | **~14 mA** |
| Awake (CAN activity detected *or* WiFi client connected) | **~50 mA** |

There are three layers of power saving. Each layer builds on the previous one and all are configured from the **Settings** page.

---

### Layer 1 — Idle AP Shutdown *(always active, no setup needed)*

After **5 minutes** with no WiFi clients connected and no CAN activity, the controller automatically shuts down the WiFi AP and turns off the LED. This runs regardless of any other Low Power settings.

As soon as CAN traffic resumes — typically the instant the car wakes up — WiFi is restored automatically. No user action required.

---

### Layer 2 — CAN Sleep *(optional)*

Enable the **CAN Sleep** toggle in Settings. When active:

- The ESP32-C6 CPU enters **light sleep** whenever FreeRTOS is idle, cutting CPU power consumption significantly.
- The TWAI (CAN) peripheral powers down during sleep but **preserves its registers and receive queue** across cycles, so no messages are lost on wake-up.
- The CAN transceiver chips remain powered and continue listening on the bus, so the first incoming frame wakes the controller instantly.

This mode gives the majority of power savings for most installs and is the recommended starting point.

---

### Layer 3 — CAN Sleep (Aggressive) *(optional, builds on Layer 2)*

Enable **CAN Sleep (Aggressive)** in Settings — everything from Layer 2 remains active, plus:

- **The CAN transceiver chips are completely shut down** (standby pin asserted). This eliminates the ~10 mA standby draw per transceiver.
- The CPU minimum clock drops to **10 MHz**.
- WiFi AP transmit power is trimmed to reduce active-client current.
- Wake is **interrupt-driven**: a GPIO ISR on each CAN_RX line fires on the first bus edge and re-enables the transceivers within microseconds. 

Use Aggressive mode when the car sits unused for days at a time and you want the absolute lowest standby current (~14 mA).

---

### How to set it up

Low Power Mode requires **one short calibration step** the first time, because every car idles its CAN bus at a slightly different rate.

**Step 1 — Measure your Sleeping CAN rate**

1. Park and lock the car. Wait 15 minutes or until the Chassis bus goes fully quiet.
2. Stay connected to the OpenHaldex WiFi AP — the controller will remain awake while a client is connected.
3. Open the Web UI → **Settings** and watch the **Chassis fps** and **Haldex fps** counters.
4. Note the highest reading you see while the car is asleep. Most cars show **800 fps**; some show a handful of fps from a periodic gateway heartbeat.

**Step 2 — Set the wake threshold**

5. Set the **LP Wake Threshold (fps)** slider to a value slightly **above** the parked-bus reading — e.g. if the bus is quiet at 0 fps, set the slider to **5**; if it idles at 8 fps, set the slider to **15**.

**Step 3 — Enable Sleep and Disconnect**

6. Enable **CAN Sleep** (and optionally **CAN Sleep (Aggressive)**) in Settings.
7. **Disconnect from the WiFi AP** (close the browser / forget the network).

The controller will now sleep, drawing ~14 mA, and **wake automatically whenever the CAN frame rate rises above the threshold** — i.e. when you unlock or start the car.  The LED, CAN chips and CPU are all off/reduced.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/Images/ui-controller-options.png" alt="Settings — Controller Options card: CAN Sleep, CAN Sleep (Aggressive), Bench Mode, LP Wake Threshold with the live Chassis / Haldex frame rate, plus Broadcast over CAN, SavvyCAN and Live Diagnostics toggles" width="300">
</p>

*Settings → **Controller Options**: everything in this section lives on one card — the two CAN Sleep toggles, Bench Mode, the **LP Wake Threshold** slider with the live **Chassis / Haldex fps** readout beneath it — alongside Broadcast over CAN, the SavvyCAN outputs, Live Diagnostics and LED brightness.*

> [!NOTE]
> **Standalone mode:** with no chassis bus, the Haldex ECU itself sleeps fully, so any Haldex-bus CAN traffic wakes the module regardless of the slider value.

> [!NOTE]
> **Switched-ignition installs:** if the module is already powered off with the ignition, Low Power Mode saves little and is optional.  

### Bench Mode

The board can't tell the difference between *harnessed to a car that's asleep* and *no harness at all* — both look like zero CAN traffic — so on the bench, with CAN Sleep on, the WiFi drops after five minutes mid-session. **Bench Mode** (Settings, under CAN Sleep) holds the WiFi up regardless.

It's safe to leave on by accident: the moment either bus shows real traffic in a power cycle, Bench Mode stops applying and normal sleep resumes, so it can't weaken the parked-car battery protection once the unit is actually installed. The web UI also greys the toggle out while CAN is detected, so it can't be switched on while harnessed to a live car in the first place.

---

## Home WiFi (Bridge Mode)

Optionally the controller can **also** join a home or garage WiFi network as a client (`WIFI_AP_STA`), so it's reachable at `openhaldex.local` — or its LAN address, shown on the card — from a phone or laptop that's already on that network, without switching WiFi to **OpenHaldex‑C6**. The controller's own access point keeps running either way; leave the field blank and nothing changes.

Set it up on the **Diagnostics** tab under **Home WiFi (Bridge Mode)** (the same card is repeated on the **OTA** tab, because this is also how the phone gets internet for [Check for updates](#doing-it-from-the-ota-page)): pick the network from the scan (or type a hidden one), enter its password, **Save & Apply**. The card then shows connection state and signal strength.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/Images/ui-bridge-mode.png" alt="Diagnostics — Home WiFi (Bridge Mode) card, connected to a home network and showing its LAN address" width="300">
</p>

Two things worth knowing:

- The ESP32‑C6 has **one radio** shared between its AP and the client side. A scan or a connection attempt pulls it off the AP's channel for a second or two. The controller therefore only looks for the home network for **20 s after starting**, then **once every 5 minutes** — so a saved home network can't keep interrupting the AP while the car is away from home.
- Bridge mode mostly doesn't change [Low Power Mode](#low-power-mode): with no CAN traffic and nobody using the controller, it still sleeps after five minutes (and drops off the home network). A browser that has the UI open through the router *does* count as "somebody" — it holds WiFi up the same way a phone joined to the AP does, so an update over the bridge can't be cut off. On the bench with nothing open, use Bench Mode.

Endpoints: `GET/POST /api/wifi/sta` `{ssid, password}` (empty `ssid` disables) · `POST /api/wifi/sta/reset` · `GET /api/wifi/scan` (asynchronous — poll until `scanning` is false).

---

## Backup & Restore

A firmware + filesystem reflash can wipe the settings stored on the device, and nobody wants to re-type an Expert grid. **Diagnostics → Backup & Restore** exports the Expert tune, steering-angle lock scale, per-generation frame edits, every setting and the WiFi names to a JSON file, and imports them back in one go.

WiFi passwords are **write-only** on the device and are never written to the file; after an import you're prompted once for any that were set.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/Images/ui-backup-restore.png" alt="Diagnostics — Backup & Restore card with Export Config and Import Config" width="300">
</p>

The same file format works from a computer with [`tools/openhaldex_config.py`](tools/openhaldex_config.py):

```
python tools/openhaldex_config.py export backup.json
python tools/openhaldex_config.py import backup.json
python tools/openhaldex_config.py import backup.json --tune-only
```

## DashCAN App (Bluetooth)

The controller also talks **Bluetooth LE** to the **DashCAN** mobile app, so the basics are on the phone without joining the **OpenHaldex‑C6** WiFi — and the app can stay connected to a DashCAN interface at the same time. The web UI remains the place for everything else (Expert maps, learning, generation setup, frame editing, OTA).

**From the app:**

- **Live** — mode buttons, controller on/off, lock target / actual, speed, throttle, rpm, boost, steering angle, CAN health and Haldex warnings (temperature protection, coupling open, speed limit).
- **Settings** — the settings you change per situation: force modes (TC off / hazard lights / external button → mode), release lock on brake / handbrake, no‑lock speed and throttle window, steering‑angle lock scaling, gradual lock release and its rate, live diagnostics, LED brightness. Changes made on the web UI show up in the app and the other way round.
- **Haldex diagnostics** — clutch / oil / module temperatures, supply voltage, clutch current and duty (and oil pressure / estimated torque on Gen4), from the same [Live Diagnostics](#live-diagnostics) pollers. Needs *Live diagnostics* switched on.
- **Gauges** — `AWD Lock`, `AWD Lock Target`, `Steering` and the Haldex temperatures can be placed on the app's dashboards and in drive recordings.

**Connecting.** With Bluetooth enabled (default), the app finds the controller as `OpenHaldex‑XXXX` and connects to the first one in range by itself; it can also be picked on the app's Bluetooth screen. Live data needs no pairing. The first change from a phone pairs it once:

- the **first phone** pairs without a code (the phone at most asks you to confirm);
- after that, **every new phone needs the 6‑digit pairing code**. It is shown in the app on an already paired phone and on the web UI (**Settings → Bluetooth**).

**On the controller:** **Settings → Bluetooth (DashCAN App)** has the enable switch, a *phone connected* indicator, the pairing code and **Forget Paired Phones** — this removes every paired phone, makes a new code, and lets the next phone pair without one again (also forget the device in the phone's Bluetooth settings). Bluetooth follows the WiFi into [Low Power Mode](#low-power-mode): it switches off when the car is parked and comes back with it.

> [!NOTE]
> Until the first phone has paired — on a new controller, or right after Forget Paired Phones — anyone within Bluetooth range could be that first phone. Pair yours straight away; if a phone you don't know got there first, use Forget Paired Phones. Firmware updates are never done over Bluetooth.

The protocol is documented in [`documents/MOBILE_APP_OPENHALDEX.md`](documents/MOBILE_APP_OPENHALDEX.md), so other apps can use it too. Endpoints: `POST /api/ble/forget`; `bleEnabled`, `blePasskey`, `bleCodeRequired` in `/api/settings`; `bleConnected`, `bleCodeRequired` in `/api/status`.

## Installation

>[!TIP]
> ### Optional Plug & Play Harness (Recommended)
>
> Recommended for quick installation (and removal) — typically **<10 minutes** on Generation 1 Controllers.
> The latest harnesses for Generation 5 are even simpler and you'll be experiencing your Haldex controller in less than 30 seconds:

- Lift the rear seat
- Split the factory 6-pin Haldex connector
- Install your new harness & OpenHaldexC6 Controller
- Drive it (you could put the seat back down too, if you want!)

> For Generation 1 Controllers:

- Remove original connector and install the long end of the harness onto the differential.
- Route the long end along with the original connector back into the boot floor via. the OEM grommet
- Install and secure the OpenHaldexC6 Controller to the new harness, pairing it with the original plug

For full step‑by‑step instructions see the **[OpenHaldex Installation Guide](https://openhaldex.com/docs/OpenHaldex_Installation_Guide.pdf)**.

> [!WARNING]
> ### Manual Wiring (No Harness)
>
> Modules sold without a harness include connector pins for manual wiring. This is a little harder and more involved than using the optional harness, but following the installation guide above it can still be completed easily. Give us a shout if you need a hand.

Gen1:
- Chassis Connector: `1J0‑973‑714`
- Haldex Conneector: `1J0‑973‑814`

Gen4>:
- Haldex Connector — `VW 1J0‑973‑713`
- Vehicle Connector — `VW 1J0‑973‑813`

Build this as a **Y-branch** harness between the two VW 8 or 6-pin connectors, with a long tail to the MX plug.

Routing summary:

- **Permanent power (Term30) and ground must also be branched to the OpenHaldex controller**:
  - Term30 -> MX Pin 1
  - Ground -> MX Pin 2
  
- Chassis CAN is taken from the Vehicle side and sent to the controller:
  - Vehicle Pin 5 -> MX Pin 3 (Chassis CAN Low)
  - Vehicle Pin 6 -> MX Pin 4 (Chassis CAN High)

- Returned CAN from the controller then goes to the Haldex side:
  - MX Pin 5 -> Haldex Pin 5 (Haldex CAN Low)
  - MX Pin 6 -> Haldex Pin 6 (Haldex CAN High)

## Firmware Installation (ESP Web Tools)

Firmware can be installed directly from your browser using **ESP Web-Tools**.  
This is the recommended method for most users.

1. Connect the OpenHaldex-C6 controller to your computer using a **data-capable USB-C cable**.
2. Open the firmware installer page: **[Module Software Updater](https://forbes-automotive.com/pages/module-software-updater?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=openhaldex)**
3. Click **Connect** and select the OpenHaldex serial port.
4. Click **Install** and follow the prompts.
5. Wait for the firmware to flash and the device to reboot.

> [!NOTE]
> Some USB-C cables are **power-only** and will not work for flashing.  
> If the device does not appear, try a different cable or USB port.

---

## OTA Updates (Wi‑Fi)

Once a controller is already running firmware **8.00.0 or later**, it can also be updated wirelessly over its own Wi‑Fi AP instead of by USB. This is a **two‑step process**, because the filesystem (web UI) and the firmware (application code) live on separate flash partitions and are updated independently:

1. **Step 1 — Filesystem update** (`POST /ota/update/fs`, uploads `littlefs.bin`)  
   Updates `index.html`, `app.js`, `style.css` and other web assets. The device does **not** reboot after this step — it's meant to be followed immediately by Step 2.
2. **Step 2 — Firmware update** (`POST /ota/update`, uploads `firmware.bin`)  
   Updates the application itself. The device reboots automatically once the upload finishes.

Both endpoints accept an optional `?sha256=<hex>` query parameter; when present the device hashes the upload as it arrives and refuses to activate an image that doesn't match. They need no password, but are **safety‑gated**:

- On the **bench** (no CAN detected), updates are allowed at any time.
- In the **vehicle** (CAN detected), an update is only allowed when the vehicle is stationary, both CAN buses are healthy, the controller is disabled or forced to Stock, and no Haldex temperature‑protection fault is active. `GET /ota/check` reports live pass/fail plus the reason if blocked.

After a firmware update the new image boots in a **pending‑verify** state (ESP‑IDF's rollback mechanism). It is only marked valid — cancelling the automatic rollback — once the web UI has been reached on the new image, or after 60 s of uptime; a build that crash‑loops before either point is reverted to the previous working firmware by the bootloader on the next reset, so a bad flash can't strand the car.

Other useful endpoints: `GET /ota/info` (current version, web‑UI version, chip, free heap, running partition), `GET /ota/fsinfo` (remounts the filesystem and reports the web‑UI version it holds — used to verify Step 1 before Step 2) and `GET /ota/health` (simple liveness check).

### Doing it from the OTA page

The **OTA** tab has three ways in, all ending in the same guided sequence (filesystem → verify → firmware → reboot) through the safety‑gated endpoints above. Nothing on the controller ever fetches from the internet; in every case it's the **browser** that gets the files and pushes them to the device.

**Option 1 — straight from GitHub.** The browser needs internet *while it can still reach the controller*. The reliable way to get that is [bridge mode](#home-wifi-bridge-mode): join the controller to your home/garage router (the **Home WiFi** card is repeated on the OTA tab for this), put the phone on the same network, and open the address the card shows. The phone keeps its normal internet and the controller is one hop away. On the bare **OpenHaldex‑C6** AP most phones drop mobile data, so that route is best‑effort.

1. Press **Check for updates**. The page first pings the controller — if it can't be reached you get a **Retry** and told why (wrong network, or the controller has gone to sleep). Then it fetches the release list. With no internet it reads the controller's bridge status and says exactly what to do next: join the network the controller is already on (address included), fix a configured‑but‑dropped link, or **Set up Home WiFi** (jumps to the card).
2. Pick a version. Newer stable releases are listed by default; tick **Show beta / older versions** to roll back. Rollback is allowed — the confirm warns that older releases may not have this page, so coming forward again could mean USB.
3. **Install**. Each image is downloaded with a progress bar, uploaded with its published SHA‑256 (the device refuses a mismatch), the filesystem is verified, then the firmware goes in and the page waits for the reboot.

Where the list comes from: [`Releases/releases.json`](Releases/releases.json) (notes, date, channel, `ota` flag, size and SHA‑256 per image — written by `tools/make_release.py`, which rescans every `Releases/V*/` folder; run it with `--reindex` after dropping a folder in by hand) merged with the `V*` folder listing from the GitHub API. A folder that isn't in the index yet still shows up, tagged *unverified* (no checksum, no notes); a folder deleted from GitHub disappears even if the index still lists it. `raw.githubusercontent.com` is tried first, then the jsDelivr mirror of the same repo.

**Option 2 — from files already on the phone, no internet needed.** Somewhere with signal, download `littlefs.bin` and `firmware.bin` from the newest `V…` folder under [`Releases/`](Releases/) (GitHub's **Download raw file** button). Back on the controller's WiFi, pick both files in one go — each is identified by its contents, not its name — and **Install picked files** runs the same sequence.

**Manual Upload** — the original one‑file‑at‑a‑time card: **Filesystem (web UI)** → `littlefs.bin`, then **Firmware (application)** → `firmware.bin`. The step tracker keeps its place across the reboot.

Keep the page open and the screen on during an install. While a browser is on the UI — including through the home router — the controller won't switch WiFi off for [Low Power Mode](#low-power-mode), and never while an upload is being written.

*OTA tab: the running firmware, the safety gate that has to read **Allowed** before an upload is accepted, and the two-step uploader (Filesystem first, then Firmware).*

> [!NOTE]
> USB via ESP Web‑Tools (above) remains the recommended method for a controller's **first** flash or for recovering from a failed update; OTA is for updating a controller that's already running.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The first release with [Bluetooth](#dashcan-app-bluetooth) changes the flash layout (bigger firmware slots, smaller web‑UI partition). A partition table can't be changed over the air, so that release is installed **once over USB** with ESP Web Tools; settings are kept. It is not offered by the OTA page on older firmware. Later updates work over OTA again.

## Status Indicators

Throughout the Web UI — Diagnostics, CAN health, force‑mode sources, and similar live readouts — status is shown as a coloured pill or dot using a consistent convention:

| Colour | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 🟢 Green | Healthy / On / Available — the signal is present and in the expected state |
| 🔴 Red | Unhealthy / Off / Inactive — the signal is present but reporting a bad or inactive state |
| 🟠 Orange | Unavailable — no value has been received for this field (e.g. not applicable to the selected Haldex generation, or data hasn't arrived yet) |

This applies to items such as Chassis/Haldex CAN health, steering health, ASR/TC status, hazard and brake/handbrake inputs, and the OTA safety banner (`SAFE` in green / `NOT SAFE` in red).

## CAN Sniffing (SavvyCAN / GVRET)

Adding more functionality couldn't be easier - you just need to know the feature you want and grab some CAN data to help implement it.  Using the SavvyCAN interface, you can listen to the CAN messages to see what the car is talking about...

> [Thanks to Maetro for this feature!]

Enable **Analyzer Mode** in the setup menu to capture CAN frames.

> [!WARNING]
> Enabling Analyzer Mode disables active Haldex control and returns the device to OEM 'pass-through' behaviour.

### SavvyCAN Connection

1. Connect to the OpenHaldex Wi‑Fi AP
2. In Settings, enable SavvyCAN via WiFi

3. In SavvyCAN:

``` 
Open 'Connection'
```

```
Add New Device Connection → Network Connection (GVRET)
```

4. Enter:

```
IP: 192.168.1.1
Port: 23
```

5. Set CAN speed:

```
500000
```

### Serial Connection

SavvyCAN can also connect directly over USB without needing Wi‑Fi:

1. Connect the OpenHaldex controller via USB-C
2. In Settings, enable SavvyCAN via Serial
3. In SavvyCAN, add a new device connection → **Serial Connection (GVRET)**
4. Select the correct COM port and set the speed to **500000**

---

## Live Diagnostics

OpenHaldex can request data from the Haldex ECU for **live measurement data** and display it in the Web UI - just like a scan tool would. This occupies the module's diagnostic channel, it is controlled by a single **Enable Live Diagnostics** toggle in Settings that is **off by default** — however if you use VCDS, ODIS or another diagnostic tool, it will automatically turn itself off until the scan tool is removed.

When enabled, the controller automatically uses the correct protocol for the configured generation — there is nothing else to select.

### Gen5 (MQB `0CQ` / PQ `0AY`) — UDS

Gets data from the Haldex ECU over ISO‑TP / UDS and decodes:

- Terminal voltage
- Control module temperature
- Clutch temperature
- Cooling‑fin temperature
- Clutch current, PWM and voltage

All scaling has been **confirmed against VCDS** by heat‑soaking a bench module and matching the reported values across the full temperature range.  

### Gen2 (`1K0`) / Gen4 (`0AY`) — KWP2000 over VW TP2.0

The PQ‑platform controllers are diagnosed with **KWP2000 tunnelled over VW TP2.0** rather than UDS. OpenHaldex opens the TP2.0 channel, starts a diagnostic session and reads the measuring blocks. Gen4 values are decoded and **confirmed against VCDS**:

- Oil temperature & clutch plate temperature
- Supply voltage
- Oil pressure
- Estimated torque
- Clutch valve duty (%) and current (A)

Raw measuring‑block bytes are also exposed so any remaining values can be characterised.

</p>

*Dashboard: with Live Diagnostics enabled the standard Haldex Data card is replaced by the **UDS Data (MQB)** card on Gen5 (left) or the **Live Data (TP2.0)** card on Gen2 / Gen4 (right).*

> [!NOTE]
> If VCDS or other scan tools will not connect, turn this setting off as it may not cleanly pick up the VCDS request so it does not block the tool.  Excessive CAN traffic can cause spurious dash errors.

## Frame Editing (Adding/Removing CAN Signals)

From the **Diagnostics** page you can enable or disable OpenHaldex's editing of **individual CAN frames** for the selected Haldex generation.

- Each editable frame for the current generation is listed as a checkbox.
- **Unchecking** a frame leaves the car's original message untouched (clean pass‑through); **checking** it lets OpenHaldex modify or generate that frame.
- Changes apply immediately and are saved per generation.
- A **Reset to Defaults** button restores the generation's standard set.

This is useful for **understanding** which edited frame upsets a Haldex learn procedure or causes fault codes, for tailoring behaviour on unusual vehicles, or for adding/removing specific signals during development.

> [!NOTE]
> Frame editing can apply to both 'Normal' and 'Standalone' modes and only to the currently selected generation.

## PCB & Enclosure

Gerber files and enclosure designs are available in the **PCB** folder.  You can use these to get your own units if you wish.

Pinout and functionality remain consistent across supported enclosure versions.
